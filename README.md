# AirQ-Forecaster: An ETL-to-ML Pipeline for Predicting Air Quality Index
### Hacktoberfest 2023 - Ploomber Mentorship Program
 

## Description

This project focuses on creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline with Ploomberfor air quality data. The pipeline fetches and processes air quality measurements from the OpenAQ API and uses DuckDB and MotherDuck for data storage and management.

We implemented the **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting to predict the Air Quality Index. ARIMA is a powerful and widely-used statistical method effective for short-term forecasting with data having seasonality, or cyclic patterns.

Key Features of ARIMA:

- **AutoRegressive (AR):** Leverages the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations (autoregression).

- **Integrated (I):** Involves differencing the time series to make it stationary, i.e., to stabilize the mean of the time series by removing changes in the level.

- **Moving Average (MA):** Models the error term as a linear combination of error terms at various times in the past.

## Data sources

OpenAQ: API designed for aggregating and sharing open air quality data from around the world.

We used an air quality sensor with location ID 380422 (49.208733, -122.9118), located in the city of New Westminster in British Columbia, Canada.

## Methods

**Include Process Flow Diagram Here (Pending)**


- **Docker Integration:** The project is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy setup and deployment. The Dockerfile provides the necessary instructions to build the Docker image.

- **Ploomber Pipeline:** The ETL process is managed using Ploomber, a workflow management tool. The pipeline configuration can be found in `pipeline.yaml`.

- **Data Extraction:** The data extraction process fetches air quality measurements from the OpenAQ API. The extraction logic is implemented in `extract_duckdb.py`.

- **Data Storage with DuckDB and MotherDuck:** The extracted data is stored in a local DuckDB instance and in the cloud using MotherDuck. DuckDB is an in-memory analytical database that supports SQL queries.

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The project includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis (see `extract.ipynb`).
